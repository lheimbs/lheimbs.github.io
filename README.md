## Welcome
Who am I?
My name is Lennart Heimbs, I am a 24 y/o medical engineering student from nuremberg, germany.
I enjoy dabbling with software development especially building small projects and learning a new languages/technologies in the process.

I am currently working on my bachelors thesis about the usage of wifi probe-requests to monitor attendance in university courses.
Additionally I'm running [my personal dashboard](https://dashboard.heimbs.me) which is a place where I currently display my room's sensor data (temperature/humidity/pressure etc.) and which I use to analyse my shopping habits.
Also, you can find my personal nextcloud file-server [here](https://files.nbg.heimbs.me)
